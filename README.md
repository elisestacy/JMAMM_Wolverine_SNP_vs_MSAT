# Comparing microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms to evaluate genetic structure and diversity in wolverines (*Gulo gulo*) across Alaska and western Canada: Journal of Mammalogy manuscript

### Code repository describing bioinformatics and R code for comparing population structure and genetic diversity analysis of wolverines across Alaska and the Yukon with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dataset generated via restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and microsatellite dataset
Authors: Elise M. Stacy, Martin D. Robards, Thomas S. Jung, Piia M. Kukka, Jack Sullivan, Paul A. Hohenlohe, and Lisette P. Waits

## Description of scripts
### RAD Seq data processing - RAD seq following "BestRAD" protocol excluding the targeted bait capture with modification to use biotinylated adapters (Ali et al. 2016) using SbfI enzyme
flip_trim: Custom Hohenlohe lab script for recognizing cutsites, barcodes, and trimming
filter_loop_range: Custom script to automate iterative filtering of individual and locus level missingness similar to approach in Oâ€™Leary et al. (2018)
